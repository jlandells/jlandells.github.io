Hello, World! I'm John, a Technical Account Manager by day, composer by night, and your guide through the ever-evolving landscape of technology.

### About This Blog

Technically Speaking is a repository of my adventures in technology. It's where I document the puzzles I've solved, the lessons I've learned, and the knowledge I've gained. This isn't just a blog—it's a shared journey. From the intricate art of programming to the sturdy structures of system architecture, the intriguing intricacies of networking, the clever tricks in Linux, to the honest insights on tech career progression, we’ll explore the many facets of the tech world.

### What You'll Find Here

- **Programming Pearls**: Code snippets, bug fixes, and scripting magic.
- **Architectural Insights**: Thoughts on designing robust systems that stand the test of time.
- **Network Navigations**: Perhaps a foray into the realms of routers, switches, and protocols.
- **Linux Lore**: Terminal tips, shell scripts, and open-source treasures.
- **Career Chronicles**: Advice on navigating the tech industry from someone who's in the trenches.

### Why GitHub Pages?

It's simple, really. GitHub is where my code lives, so it makes sense for my tech musings to reside here too. Plus, with GitHub Pages, I can focus on content while it takes care of the presentation.
